## Interpreting your results - outline

#### General principles
- You should always "know" what the model will do before running it. Running models without a general idea of the anticipated results is *seriously* dangerous.

#### Tricks for detailed comparisons
- Plotting in 2 stacked/linked windows in **ParaView**
  - Split the window and link cameras as described in the outline for Lesson 08.
- Differencing input files
  - In NotePad++ you can install the Compare plugin, open 2 input files and select Plugins -> Compare -> Compare.
- Working from a "known good" model
  - If you find yourself in a position where you're not able to figure out what is wrong with a given model, and you know it was based on an earlier design, it is best to return to the "working" model and incrementally make changes to identify the problem. It may be slow and a bit painful, but this works.
