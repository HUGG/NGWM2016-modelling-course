#### General principles
- You should always "know" what the model will do before running it. Running models without a general idea of the anticipated results is *seriously* dangerous.

#### Tricks for detailed comparisons
- Plotting in 2 stacked/linked windows in **ParaView**
- Differencing input files
- Working from a "known good" model
